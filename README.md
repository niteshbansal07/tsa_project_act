# Time Series Analysis for Insurance Loss Data (Python)

This repo demonstrates practical time-series reasoning using **monthly loss data**:
trend, seasonality, smoothing, and a simple baseline forecast.

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.generate_data
python -m src.analyze
```

## Next 
- ARIMA/ETS models, outlier handling, separate frequency vs severity series, and credibility blending.
